## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

**The complete web AirBnB application**

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

**A commandline interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.**

we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

**How to Start the app:**

* Execute the command *./console.py*

**How to use the app:**

* At the prompt type the command you want to execute and the result willbe displayed on a newline

**Example:**

(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
